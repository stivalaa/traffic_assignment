Implementation of single-source shortest path based on:

Okuyama, Ino, Hagihara 2008 "A Task Parallel Algorithm for Computing
the costs of All-Pairs Shortest Paths on the CUDA-compatible GPU"
Intl. Symp. Parallel Distributed Processing with Applications. 284-291

See also:

Harish and Narayanan 2007 "Accelerating Large Graph Algorithms on the GPU
Using CUDA" HiPC 2007, LNCS 4873: 197-208

and:

Martin, Torres, Gavilanes "CUDA Solutions for the SSSP Problem"
ICCS 2009, LNCS 5544: 904-913

(this latter describes why the Harish and Naryanan algorithm contains
a bug (write-after-write inconsisnecty), note the Harish&Narayanan
algorithm is also the basis of Okuyama et al's algorithm for solving
serveral SSSPs at once for higher efficiency).


The sssp_gold.cpp module for verifying the results uses the Dijkstra's
algorithm implementation in the Boost Graph Library.

The sssp_pape.c module uses the d'Esopo-Pape label-correcting algorithm
(on host CPU) for further comparison.
